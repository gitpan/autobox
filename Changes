2.00  Sun Feb 17 02:29:11 2008
    - API changes:
        autobox with one or more args leaves the unspecified types unboxed
        multiple autobox (or autobox subclass) invocations in the same lexical scope
            are merged (thanks Matsuno Tokuhiro)
        multiple bindings for each type can be supplied as an ARRAY ref of classes
            or namespaces
        "no autobox qw(...)" disables/resets bindings for the specified type(s)

    - perl 5.10 compatibility fixes (thanks Andreas Koenig)
    - document previously undocumented features
    - document subclassing
    - merge.t: test merging
    - beef up the default DEBUG handler so that it shows the superclasses
      of the synthetic classes
