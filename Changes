    - This version provides a new patch which ensures
      that undef values aren't autoboxed. It should
      be applied to a clean perl-5.8.1-RC4 tree
    - fixed (i.e. prevented) autoboxing of undef in isa() and can()
    - fixed Makemaker.PL and META.yml to ensure that new
      installs of autobox.pm aren't shadowed by old
      versions (thanks Michael G Schwern)
