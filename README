autobox version 0.04
=========================

The autobox pragma endows Perl's core datatypes with the capabilities of
first-class objects. This enables methods to be called on ARRAY refs,
HASH refs, CODE refs and raw SCALARs in exactly the same manner as blessed
references. The autoboxing is transparent: boxed values are not blessed
into their (user-defined) implementation class (unless the method elects to
bestow such a blessing) - they simply use its methods as though they are.

autobox is lexically scoped, and handlers for an outer scope
can be overridden or countermanded in a nested scope.

See the POD for more details.

INSTALLATION

First of all, you won't be able to run this module unless
you have applied the patch included in the patch directory
to (currently) perl-5.8.1-RC4.

The procedure for installing the patch is quite straightforward:

    cd /path/to/perl-5.8.1-RC4/
    patch < /path/to/autobox.diff

Once that patch has been applied, and the patched perl has been
installed, it's the usual incantation:

   perl_autobox Makefile.PL # i.e. your patched perl
   make
   make test
   make install

There are no builtin SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH or CODE classes. You'll
have to supply those yourself.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the patch referred to above.
